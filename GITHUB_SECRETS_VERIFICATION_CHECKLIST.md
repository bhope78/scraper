# 🔍 GitHub Secrets Verification Checklist

## Immediate Action Plan for Authentication Fix

### ✅ Pre-Implementation Checklist

**Before making any changes, verify current state:**

- [ ] **Repository Access**: Can access https://github.com/bhope78/scraper
- [ ] **Current Token**: Have valid Cloudflare API token
- [ ] **Local Environment**: Can run `npm test` locally (with token)
- [ ] **GitHub Actions**: Can view workflow runs and logs

### 🔧 Step 1: Verify Current Cloudflare Token

**Check your existing token:**

```bash
# Test if you have a working token locally
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="your_existing_token"
node token-validator.js quick
```

**Expected output if working:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-15T..."
}
```

**If token fails, create new one:**

1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
2. Click "Create Token" → "Custom token"
3. Configure:
   ```
   Permissions:
   ✅ Cloudflare D1:Edit
   ✅ Account:Read

   Account Resources:
   ✅ Include: [Your Account]
   
   Zone Resources:
   ⚪ Not needed
   ```
4. Copy token (starts with underscore, ~40 characters)

### 🔐 Step 2: Update GitHub Repository Secret

**Access repository secrets:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/bhope78/scraper/settings/secrets/actions
2. Look for existing `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` secret

**If secret exists:**
- [ ] Click "Update" next to `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
- [ ] Paste your working token (complete, no quotes)
- [ ] Click "Update secret"

**If secret doesn't exist:**
- [ ] Click "New repository secret"
- [ ] Name: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (exact match)
- [ ] Value: [your complete token]
- [ ] Click "Add secret"

### 🧪 Step 3: Test GitHub Actions Setup

**Manual workflow test:**

1. Go to: https://github.com/bhope78/scraper/actions
2. Click "CalCareers D1 Scraper" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Configure test run:
   ```
   Branch: main (or your current branch)
   ✅ Run with debug logging: true
   ✅ Force scrape even if health check fails: true
   ```
5. Click "Run workflow"

**Monitor the test:**
- [ ] **Health-check job completes** (should be green ✅)
- [ ] **Authentication test passes** (check logs)
- [ ] **D1 connection successful** (verify database access)
- [ ] **Scrape job starts** (may take a few minutes)

### 🔍 Step 4: Analyze Results

**If health-check job PASSES:**
- ✅ Authentication is working
- ✅ GitHub Secrets configured correctly
- ✅ System ready for regular operation

**If health-check job FAILS:**

Check specific error messages:

| Error Pattern | Solution |
|---------------|----------|
| "CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN secret is not set" | Secret missing - add to repository |
| "Token format may be incorrect" | Token malformed - regenerate |
| "Authentication test failed" | Token invalid - check permissions |
| "D1 connection test failed" | Database access issue - verify D1 permissions |

### 🛠️ Step 5: Fix Common Issues

**Issue: Secret not found**
```bash
# Verify secret name exactly matches
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN  ✅ Correct
Cloudflare_API_Token  ❌ Wrong case
CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY    ❌ Wrong name
```

**Issue: Token format problems**
```bash
# Correct format (example)
_1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678  ✅

# Wrong formats
"_1234567890abcdef..."  ❌ Has quotes
_1234...                ❌ Too short
1234567890abcdef...     ❌ Missing underscore
```

**Issue: Permission problems**
- [ ] Token has D1:Edit permission
- [ ] Account scope includes your account
- [ ] Token not expired
- [ ] Account has D1 access

### 🚨 Step 6: Emergency Verification

**If authentication still fails after fixes:**

1. **Test token outside GitHub Actions:**
   ```bash
   # Local test with your token
   export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="your_token"
   npx wrangler d1 list
   ```

2. **Verify token permissions manually:**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/user/tokens/verify" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
   ```

3. **Check Cloudflare account status:**
   - Log into Cloudflare dashboard
   - Verify account is active
   - Check D1 database "Calhr" exists

### ✅ Step 7: Confirm Success

**Successful implementation indicators:**

- [ ] **Health-check job**: ✅ Green status
- [ ] **Authentication logs**: "Authentication successful"
- [ ] **D1 connection**: "D1 database connection successful"
- [ ] **Scrape job**: Starts without authentication errors
- [ ] **Summary report**: Shows job counts and recent additions

**Expected workflow output:**
```
✅ CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN secret is present
✅ Token format looks correct
✅ Authentication test passed
✅ D1 connection test passed
```

### 🔄 Step 8: Schedule Regular Monitoring

**Set up ongoing monitoring:**

1. **Enable workflow notifications:**
   - Go to repository Settings → Notifications
   - Enable "Actions" notifications
   - Configure email/mobile alerts

2. **Monitor workflow runs:**
   - Check daily scraper runs
   - Review job success/failure patterns
   - Monitor authentication health

3. **Periodic token maintenance:**
   - Set calendar reminder for token expiration
   - Test authentication monthly
   - Keep backup tokens if needed
