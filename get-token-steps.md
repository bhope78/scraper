# üîê Quick Steps to Get Your API Token

## Since you're logged into Cloudflare:

1. **Go directly to API Tokens page:**
   https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens

2. **Look for existing tokens or create new one:**
   - If you see "GitHub Actions D1 Scraper" token - click "View" to see it
   - If not, click "Create Token"

3. **For NEW token, use these EXACT permissions:**
   ```
   Account - D1:Edit
   Account - Account Settings:Read
   Account - Cloudflare Workers:Edit
   ```

4. **Copy the token** (starts with underscore: `_xxxxx...`)

5. **Test it locally:**
   ```bash
   # In your terminal, paste:
   export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="_paste_your_token_here"
   
   # Then run:
   node analyze-token.js
   ```

## What to look for in existing tokens:
- Token name contains "D1" or "GitHub" or "Scraper"
- Has D1 permissions
- Status is "Active"

## If you see your token in the list:
1. Click on it to view details
2. Check if it has D1 permissions
3. If yes, click "Roll" to regenerate it
4. Copy the new token

Let me know when you have the token copied!
